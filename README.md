[Python Script]

In this project I wanted to create an interactive dashboard to look at trends between some of the biggest companies on the stock market. The raw data included the following field values:

Date
Open Price
High Price
Low Price
Close Price
Adjusted Close
Volume

To more easily interpret the data and identify trends, I used Python to add the following fields:

50 Day Moving Average
200 Day Moving Average
Previous Day Close Price
Change in Price
Percent Change in Price
Previous Day Volume
Change in Volume
Percent Change in Volume
